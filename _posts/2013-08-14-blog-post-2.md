Euclid's algorithm finds us the greatest common divisor (also known as the greatest common multiple) of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Euclid's extended algorithm, meanwhile, not only finds the greatest common divisor but also finds some integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:

\\[ ax + by = gcd(a,b) \\]

There are, of course, many different implementations of this algorithm however the one I would like to showcase today is written in base python, and given below.

<h4>
```python
def extended_euclid(a,b):
    a0 = [a,1,0]
    a1 = [b,0,1]
    temp = [0,0,0]
    while a1[0]:
        temp = a1
        q = int(a0[0]/a1[0])
        a1 = [a0[i]-q*a1[i] for i in range(3)]
        a0 = temp
    return a0
```
