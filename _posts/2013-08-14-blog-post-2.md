Euclid's algorithm finds us the greatest common divisor (also known as the greatest common multiple) of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Euclid's extended algorithm, meanwhile, not only finds the greatest common divisor but also finds some integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:

\\[ ax + by = gcd(a,b) \\]

There are, of course, many different implementations of this algorithm however the one I would like to showcase today is written in base python, and given below.

```python
def extended_euclid(a,b):
    a0 = [a,1,0]
    a1 = [b,0,1]
    while a1[0]:
        temp = a1
        q = int(a0[0]/a1[0])
        a1 = [a0[i]-q*a1[i] for i in range(3)]
        a0 = temp
    return a0
```
Before discussing what this code does, it first might help to know what its inputs and outputs are. In this case, the inputs are two integers, a and b. The output, meanwhile, is a vector with the entries \\( (gcd(a,b), x, y) \\) with \\( x,y \\) being the same \\( x,y \\) as in equation 1.

To unpack how this code works, let's go line by line through and see what each component is doing. In the beggining, we define two "vectors", these being \\( a_0 = (a,1,0) \\) and \\( a_1 = (b,0,1) \\). You can think of these vectors as encoding, in a way, an equation about \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), essentially saying:

\\[ a = ( 1 \times a ) + ( 0 \times b ) \\]

\\[ b = ( 0 \times a ) + ( 1 \times b ) \\]

From here, it is worth looking at what is going on inside the while loop before zooming out to see why we care about the truth value of a0.

To start, we store the vector \\( a_1 \\) temporarily. Afterwards, we define \\( q \\) as equal to \\( \left \lfloor{a/b}\right \rfloor \\) where \\( a,b \\) are the first values in the vectors \\( a_0 \\) and \\( a_1 \\) respectively.

Note that this definition means that when we do \\(a_2 = a_0 - q\times a_1\\), we are guaranteed to have a vector whose first element is a multiple of the first elements of \\( a_0, a_1\\). To see this, try re-write the algorithm using only the first elements of each vector and note that it is identical to the [standard euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).
