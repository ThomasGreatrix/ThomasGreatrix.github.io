Euclid's algorithm finds us the greatest common divisor (also known as the greatest common multiple) of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Euclid's extended algorithm, meanwhile, not only finds the greatest common divisor but also finds some integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:

\\[ ax + by = gcd(a,b) \\]
