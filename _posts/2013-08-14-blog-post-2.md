Euclid's algorithm finds us the greatest common divisor (also known as the greatest common multiple) of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Euclid's extended algorithm, meanwhile, not only finds the greatest common divisor but also finds some integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that:

\\[ ax + by = gcd(a,b) \\]

There are many different approaches to coding up the extended euclidean algorithm, however the one we will be using today is as follows:

\\
def extended_euclid(a,b):\\
    a0 = [a,1,0]\\
    a1 = [b,0,1]\\
    temp = [0,0,0]\\
    while a1[0]:\\
        temp = a1\\
        q = int(a0[0]/a1[0])\\
        a1 = [a0[i]-q*a1[i] for i in range(3)]\\
        a0 = temp\\
    return a0\\
