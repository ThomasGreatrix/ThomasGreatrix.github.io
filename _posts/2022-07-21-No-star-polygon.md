The 2D [integer lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_lattice) is currently one of my favourite geometric structures, perhaps due to how intuitive it is to explain to somebody perhaps not interested in maths, coupled with the sheer volume of beautiful, intelligent proofs surrounding it. Today, I hope to share just one of these proofs.

Formally, the integer lattice can be seen as the cartesian product \\( ( \mathbb{Z}x\mathbb{z} ) \\).
