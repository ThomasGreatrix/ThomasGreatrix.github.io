Current student in mathematics at Cardiff University. I have interests within coding, especially python. This website will mainly contain small coding projects, mathematical proofs, and mathematical explanations. On occasion, I will also provide larger projects, or provide ideas in topics surrounding mathematics including but not limited to its history, pedagogy, and applications.
